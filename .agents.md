# Agent Instructions

This file demonstrates whether GitHub Copilot reads `.agents.md` files.

## About .agents.md Files

The `.agents.md` file is a convention used by some AI coding assistants to provide context and instructions to the agent when working on a repository.

## GitHub Copilot vs Claude

- **GitHub Copilot**: GitHub Copilot primarily focuses on code completion and suggestions based on the code context. It does not typically read custom instruction files like `.agents.md`.

- **Claude/Anthropic-based agents**: Claude-based coding agents, such as those using the Anthropic API, can be configured to read custom instruction files including `.agents.md` files when they are present in a repository.

## Conclusion

The `.agents.md` file convention is indeed more commonly associated with Claude/Anthropic-based agents rather than GitHub Copilot. GitHub Copilot's behavior is primarily driven by:
- Code context in the current file
- Comments in the code
- File structure and naming conventions
- Standard documentation files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.)

If you want to provide instructions to AI coding assistants, consider:
1. Using well-structured README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files
2. Adding clear comments in your code
3. Following consistent naming conventions
4. Using standard documentation practices

This file serves as a demonstration that `.agents.md` files can be created, but their effectiveness depends on the specific AI tool being used.
