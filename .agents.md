# Note on `.agents.md` Files

This file exists to demonstrate that `.agents.md` is **not a standard convention** recognized by most AI coding assistants.

## The Reality

- **GitHub Copilot**: Does NOT read `.agents.md`. Uses `.github/copilot-instructions.md` instead.
- **Claude-based agents**: May read custom instruction files, but `.agents.md` is not a standard convention.
- **Cursor/Cline**: Use `.cursorrules` as the standard convention.

## What You Should Use Instead

For comprehensive agent support across different AI tools, see `AGENT_NOTES.md` in this repository.

**TL;DR**: Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot and `.cursorrules` for broader compatibility with Claude-based tools and VSCode extensions.
