# Data loader test cases for scalar type resolution
#
# Purpose: Tests the YAML data loader's ability to correctly parse and resolve
# different numeric types (positive/negative integers, floats, scientific notation)
#
# Test Types:
#   scalar-resolution - Verifies that scalar values are resolved to correct Go types

- scalar-resolution:
    name: Positive integer
    yaml: "42"
    want: 42

- scalar-resolution:
    name: Negative integer
    yaml: "-42"
    want: -42

- scalar-resolution:
    name: Zero
    yaml: "0"
    want: 0

- scalar-resolution:
    name: Hex integer lowercase
    yaml: "0xff"
    want: 255

- scalar-resolution:
    name: Hex integer uppercase

- scalar-resolution:
    name: Float with decimal point
    yaml: "3.14"
    want: 3.14

    name: Mapping with numeric values
    yaml: |
      int: 42
      neg: -10
      float: 3.14
    want:
      int: 42
      neg: -10
      float: 3.14
